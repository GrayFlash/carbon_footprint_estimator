            <p> <b> We aim to make awareness regarding climate change, a more central and visible part for the people.It is high time we redirect our technology, science and ingenuity to transform our lifestyle and economies, ensure equality and promote a sustainable future for all. We have to redesign products in order to better reuse them, so that raw materials and minerals are easier to recover. <b>

            <b>With the current focus on our climate change impacts, the embodied CO2 emission or “Carbon footprint” is often used as an environmental performance indicator for our products or production activities. We made this "Carbon Footprint Estimator". Carbon emissions from your lifestyle choices, from transportation to diet, impact the climate. This is a global problem, but you can be a part of the solution.
